# Overview of machine learning pipelines using the Azure Machine Learning SDK

## What are machine learning pipelines?

Using [Azure Machine Learning SDK for Python](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/python/api/azureml-pipeline-core/?view=azure-ml-py), data scientists, data engineers, and IT professionals can collaborate on the steps involved in:
* Data preparation, such as normalization and transformations
* Model training
* Model evaluation
* Deployment

The following diagram shows an example pipeline:
