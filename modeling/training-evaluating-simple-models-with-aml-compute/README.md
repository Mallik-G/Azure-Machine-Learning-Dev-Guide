# Training and Evaluating a few simple models Using Azure Notebooks and Azure Machine Learning compute (Code Sample)

Azure Machine Learning service provides a code-first experience where you can use the [Azure Machine Learning SDK for Python](https://docs.microsoft.com/python/api/overview/azure/ml/intro?view=azure-ml-py) to start training your models on your local machine and then scale out to use Azure Machine Learning compute target to train better performing, highly accurate machine learning and deep learning models. Azure Machine Learning service supports many of the popular open-source machine learning and deep learning Python packages, such as:

- [Scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/)
- [Tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org/)
- [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/)
- [Keras](https://keras.io/)

The goal of this article is to show how [Azure Machine Learning SDK for Python](https://docs.microsoft.com/python/api/overview/azure/ml/intro?view=azure-ml-py) can be used to train models locally and on AML compute cluster. We will also look at how to log metrics during training, monitor training runs, and visualize model performance in Azure Machine Learning.

## Training using local compute (of Azure Notebook)

## Training using AML compute cluster

## Logging during the model training process

## Monitoring model training progress

## Visualizing model performance
        
## Next steps

Please see the following additional references on training on local and AML compute custer in Azure Machine Learning service:
