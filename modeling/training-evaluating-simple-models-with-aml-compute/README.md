# Training and Evaluating a few simple models Using Azure Notebooks and Azure Machine Learning compute (Code Sample)

## Training using local compute (of Azure Notebook)

## Training using AML compute cluster

## Logging during the model training process

## Monitoring model training progress

## Visualizing model performance
        
## Next steps
