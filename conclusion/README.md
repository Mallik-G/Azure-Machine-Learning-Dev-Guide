# Conclusion

In conclusion, you have seen through this Azure Machine Learning Developer Guide how Microsoft has been leading the way in AI and in providing the tools and services needed to help organizations of all sizes benefit from the capabilities it provides. This Developer Guide helped recognize the vast number of technologies that you, as a data scientist, developer, or data engineer, can use to harness the power of AI and machine learning (ML). From fully managed pre-built AI models ([Azure Cognitive Services](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/cognitive-services/)) to tools and services that enable you to build and deploy your custom models, with [Azure Machine Learning service](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/machine-learning/service/overview-what-is-azure-ml) at its core.

This guide provided documentation, code samples and best practices for harnessing the power of Azure Machine Learning. Whether you are a data scientist, data engineer, or developer, keep this guide nearby while learning AI fundamentals and how to use Azure Machine Learning service and related tools to grow your AI practice and learn new skills.
